      System. You must create rules that determine the character''s behavior with
      the goal of surviving as long as possible.


      Within the game, there are
      elements that represent the components of an RBS: the fact base, the knowledge
      base, and the inference engine.'

      behavior.


      Rules are created using block-based programming. The antecedents
      are conditions that must be met by checking the Fact Base, and the consequents
      are actions to be executed by the character.'

    m_Localized: 'The Fact Base stores the current information related to our problem:
      survival. It functions as the knowledge the character has about their environment
      and themselves, including the state of their attributes and the elements detected
      around them. Therefore, this information is dynamic and changes over time.


      At
      the start, the Fact Base contains initial facts, which represent the character''s
      initial situation. During the process, inferred facts are generated based on
      this initial information.


      This information is used in the Knowledge
      Base to construct rules.'

    m_Localized: 'To create a set of rules, we must go to the Knowledge Base section.
      Using the blank space on the left, we will select the blocks and connect them
      together. First, we need to use the event button followed by the ''Rules''
      block to indicate that our structure is a rule-based system.


      For each
      rule we want to create, we must use the ''Rule'' block, placing the antecedents
      of the rule at the top and the consequents at the bottom. Here is an example.












      If
      you want to see what each block is for, hover the mouse over it to display
      a brief description.'
